## 1. Introduction to HTML

### Crash course

HTML is the foundation of web development. It is an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is used to structure content on a webpage. What do we mean by content? Plain text, images, videos, links to other websites, etc. The structure gives content meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images.

In order to learn HTML properly it's important to know what is is. Go through the following resources to learn more about it:

- [HTML5 Basics - History of HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzzGt7EmXVw)
- [HTML Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)

### The most commonly used tags

If at any point you came to believe you would have to learn a whole list of tags by heart in order to write great HTML, you are in luck: that's not needed.

The most important thing to know is that the tags are used to **structure content**, or in other words: to decide how each part is organized in order to more easily understand what the page is trying to communicate.

It's useful to memorize this list, but don't feel like you have to learn and memorize _every_ HTML tag. Once you understand the basics, you can easily look up which tag you need.

Check out the following article to find a list of the most commonly used tags: [The Most Commonly Used Tags](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-commonly-used-tags-in-html/)

## Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML are HTML tags that introduce meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a `<p>` tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. A `<nav>` tag indicates a navigation menu of some kind. Both examples show meaning and structure, in this way it's easier to understand for both the browser and the developer.

This leads to the following insight about writing code: while code is written to produce working software, it should also be written so **other developers can easily read and understand it**. That's why it's so important to write meaningful code: if somebody else can read it and understand what you meant you did a great job!

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about semantic HTML:

- [Semantic HTML](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/semantic-html/)
- [HTML5 as Fast as Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsXEVQRaTX8)

## 2. Introduction to CSS

### Crash course

CSS is just as important as HTML. It is an acronym for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a language created to change the appearance of content. By referring to the HTML tags you can `style` it in various ways: change the `font-size`, increase the `height` or attach a `background-image` to it.

Go through the following video to get a firmer grasp of the fundamentals of CSS:

- [CSS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI)

### Where to write it?

There are 3 basic ways to write CSS:

- In an external stylesheet: a `.css` file, that is linked to a `.html` file using the following tag:

```html
<link href="/path/to/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

- In the `<head>` of a `.html` file. This is done using the `<style>` tag. This is called an `internal stylesheet`:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: blue;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

- As part of the attribute `style` inside any HTML tag. This is called `inline styling`:

```html
<div style="background-color: blue;">HackYourFuture is cool!</div>
```

In practice, you'll always write your CSS in separate `.css` files. This is because you want to make sure **every file has a single purpose**: an HTML file should only contain the content and structure of a page, while a stylesheet should only contain styling rules that apply to a page.

This is a software design principle called [`separation of concerns`](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/32581/how-do-you-explain-separation-of-concerns-to-others).

### The box model

"In CSS, everything is a box". This phrase summarizes a central concept in HTML/CSS: the box model. When building a web page each element can be considered a box that has the following properties: `margin`, `border`, `padding` and `content`. Starting from the first element within the `<body>`, everything that comes after will be pushed down (thanks to these 4 properties).

To learn more about the box model, go through the following:

- [Opening the Box Model](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/opening-the-box-model/)

### The cascading effect

The first C in CSS stands for Cascading and it's crucial to learning how to use CSS correctly. Essentially, it means that it matters
(1) **in which order** and
(2) **how specific** you write CSS rules.

Read the following articles to learn about it:

- [The "C" in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/the-c-in-css-the-cascade/).
- [How CSS works: understanding the cascade](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-css-works-understanding-the-cascade-d181cd89a4d8)

### Specificity

As there are multiple ways to write your css code which leads to multiple rules applying to the same html element CSS needs to decide which rule to follow. In the simplest form, if we for example have the following HTML:

```html
<p>This paragraph should be styled normally</p>
<p class="explanation">
  This paragraph should be styled differently as we add a class to the element
</p>
```

and the following CSS:

```css
p .explanation {
  font-weight: 600;
}

p {
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

Then because the `p .explanation` rule is more specific than the `p` rule the `font-weight` of our second paragraph will be `600` even though the other rule was applied last. Read the following articles to learn more about how it works:

## 3. Working with the browser

### What is a web browser?

You probably use it daily. Let's take a closer look at what it actually is.

A `web browser` is software that allows you to view webpages, either retrieved from the internet or loaded from your computer. The primary function of a web browser is to render HTML files: transforming all the code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) as well as the references (images, videos, etc.) to display a page correctly.

For further study, delve into the following:

- [What is a browser?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcbhVv9ty44)
- [How web browsers work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjDrMKZWCt0)

### Choosing the right browser

As a web developer you will write code that will display in different browsers. As such it is important that you get familiar with most major browsers in use today. These are:

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) (Not available for Mac/Linux yet)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

In your HackYourFuture journey you'll mainly be using **Google Chrome** when developing, as is has great developer tools that allow us to develop web applications in an easier and clearer way.

### How to use the browser inspector

The inspector is a part of web browsers developers can use to take a closer look at the composition of the HTML elements. This makes it easier to write HTML and CSS code that works.

Watch the following videos and follow along:

- [Using browser inspector tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJIqIDm7CoA)
- [Google Chrome Developer Tools Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4q86IjJFag)

### Useful browser extensions

As web developers we'll be dealing with the browser all the time. Why not upgrade our browser so it can make our programming life easier?

A `browser extension` is a piece of software someone has written to increase the capability of the web browser. For example, if you hate receiving advertisements you probably use something like [Adblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) to block all the unwanted ads you might find in your webpages (if not, download it as soon as possible!).

The following is a list of extensions that have proven to be useful during web development. This list only applies for Google Chrome, so if you don't have it, [install it](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

Extensions:

- Modify the technologies underlying each website, in real time, using [Web developer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm/related?hl=en-US)
- Expose what technologies a website is using with [WhatRuns](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatruns/cmkdbmfndkfgebldhnkbfhlneefdaaip?hl=en-US)
- If you ever wanted to know the exact color of any element in a page, you can now do so with [ColorZilla](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp?hl=en-US)

There are many more of these extensions and we encourage you to explore. See what fits your needs!
