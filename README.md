# HackYourFuture explore

The explore module is your first look at what being a developer is, and at how the HackYourFuture program works. By completing it, you will also have a better idea of what will be expected of you throughout the 7 months of studying at HackYourFuture, so you can make an informed decision on whether you want to commit your time to getting into the tech industry.

Before diving in, please visit our [application page](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/apply) to learn more about the selection process at HackYourFuture. Note that our course is exclusively for people with a refugee background, and your application may be declined for non-technical reasons. If you are not sure if you are eligible, please contact us at info@hackyourfuture.net with an explanation of your situation and we will get back to you. Completing this module is no guarantee to getting into the program, but it will always be a good first step into web development.

Now let's get to the fun stuff:

## Module overview

Welcome to the wonderful world of web development! In this module, you will learn the basic building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS and JS. HTML gives us the power to add text, images and videos to a page. CSS gives us the power to organize these parts and make it look nice. JS gives us the power to perform logical operations, to react to what the user is doing.

Think of it like this: if a webpage were a person, the HTML would be the skeleton, the CSS the skin and clothing and the JS the brain!

This module will handle the very basics of what is called `frontend` (as opposed to `backend` which we will handle later in the HackYourFuture curriculum). What is frontend? It's another word for the presentational part of a piece of software. In terms of web development, we're talking about "what you see" when you go to any website.

### Learning Goals

In order to successfully complete this module, you will need to master the following:

- Be able to write syntactically correct `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS`
- Understand what is meant by `responsive` web development
- Know your way around `Visual Studio Code`
- Feel comfortable working with your `browser's inspector`
- Know what we mean with `variables`, `operators`, `objects` and `arrays` in `JavaScript`
- Understand what the `DOM` is
- Use the basics of `DOM Manipulation`

### Repository content

This repository, as every repository in the HackYourFuture curriculum, consists of 2 essential parts:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand. It contains not only the right resources to learn about the concepts, but also lectures done by HackYourFuture volunteers.
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's practical side. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier.

We provide a subset of materials that touches on all the concepts we would like you to learn and do. This is enough for some, but not for others. It is up to you to define what you need more information on. If you do need more information, you can search the internet for more explanations. Luckily there is a lot of information out there, so it should not be too hard to find something that fits your learning style!
