### 1. 30 days of JavaScript

So you will notice that we are skipping Loops here. We opt to skip this for now as you will most likely not need it for the final assignment when applying to HYF. It is the last big building block of JavaScript though and if you want to go a little further then have a look at it! We will go through it in the main curriculum at any rate.

- [30 Days of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/readMe.md). Do day 7 and 8.

### 2. Exercises

In the following exercises you'll learn how to use different JavaScript concepts to solve common computational problems.

- [Learn-js](https://www.learn-js.org/). Do the following `Learn the basics` exercises:
  - Objects
  - Functions
- [Codecademy: Introduction to Functions](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions/exercises/intro-to-functions).
- [jshero.net](https://www.jshero.net/en/success.html). Do exercises #6-#46
- [Making webpages interactive](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js)

The above should give you some good practice again. If you have extra time and want to continue practicing, have a look at the following:

- [FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript). You can choose whichever ones you feel are challenging enough.

## Finished?

Are you finished with going through the exercises? Well done, you have now gone through all of the materials in the starter repository of HYF!!! You should be proud of yourself as this is not easy.

We hope you enjoyed the module and have a better idea of what web development is all about. If you are now excited to become a web developer then look at our [website](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/apply) when the next class application closes.

In the meantime you can continue learning by looking at our [what's next section](../NEXT.md).
